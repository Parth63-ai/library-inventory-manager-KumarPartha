This is a simple Python-based Library Inventory Management System created using
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It uses a text file (`library.txt`) to
store book records and provides a menu-driven Command Line Interface (CLI).

This version is implemented in a **single Python file**:  
`Library_management.py`
